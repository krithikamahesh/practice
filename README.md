> This html version of ipython notebook contains a formal introduction to the k-means algorithm with it's serial impelmentation.
> As an improvement to k-means, an implementation of k-means++ which better initializes centroids is provided. 
> The notebook finishes with a distributed version of k-means using pyspark.
> Data is generated using scikit.

**Gradient Descent**

View file here: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/krithikamahesh/practice/blob/master/StochasticGradientDescentVariations.html

> This html version of ipython notebook contains practice codes for gradient descent and it's variants:
> Batch, Stochastic and Mini-batch gradient descent.
> Loss and number of iterations are comparatively analyzed for these approaches of gradient descent.
> The notebook contains a distributed implementation of mini-batch gradient descent.
